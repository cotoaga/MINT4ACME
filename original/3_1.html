<P>
MINT will be <A HREF="4_5.html#layout">highly graphical</A> in concept: the application will be capable of displaying all kinds of files that are supported in a browser environment.
This will naturally evolve with time, as HTML evolves itselfe, effectively
giving ACME a self-evolving application at no extra cost.
</P>
<P>Initially <A HREF="4_8.html">supported file formats</A> will be:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
GIF and JPEG for <A HREF="4_8.html#pictures">pictures</A>
</LI>
<LI>
MPEG, AVI and QuickTime for <A HREF="4_8.html#videos">video</A>
</LI>
<LI>
Virtual reality worlds built with <A HREF="4_8.html#vrml">VRML</A>
</LI>
<LI>
Wave, MIDI and different <A HREF="4_8.html#sound">sound</A> streams
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
MINT will consist of functionality pages (little text, many graphics, functionality
controls) and <A HREF="4_9.html">help pages</A> (much text, many how-to wizards and controls).
The Help pages will be capable of being accessed directly (as a manual),
as in-context Help, and automatically in case of repeated errors.
</P>
<P>
MINT will be capable of supporting and integrating the following <A HREF="2_2.html">vehicle
sales processes</A>. The Chapter Technical Environment shows for some of the following
processes examples how the different <A HREF="4_4.html">MINT versions</A> will support these processes
at different sites:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The <A HREF="2_2.html#closurephase">assisted sales process</A> at the sales location, where the customer visits the dealership in order to investigate and possibly buy a car; at the <A HREF="4_3.html">dealership</A> he/she interacts with a sales representative in what is the current classical sales process.
</LI>
<LI>
The assisted sales process at the customer location, where the customer
is visited by a sales representative at his/her home, office or other convenient
location for the <A HREF="4_4.html#negotiationphase">negotiation phase</A>; the sales representative carries information about the car or car range and may physically drive a specimen car to the customer.
</LI>
<LI>
The unassisted sales process at the <A HREF="2_2.html#infophase">information location</A>, where the customer can retrieve a large amount of information about a car or car family and
receive a quote. This may happen outside or inside a sales location, depending
on where the information location (<A HREF="4_4.html">kiosk</A>) is placed. When the kiosk is
located inside a sales location, this process may transform itself into
the assisted sales process at the sales location.
</LI>
<LI>
The unassisted sales process at the <A HREF="4_3.html#acmeweblayer">customer location</A>, where the customer can, by using his/her PC, retrieve a large amount of information about
a car or car family and receive a quote. He should also be capable, by
using his own equipment to electronically access a ACME or dealer-owned
information pool, of obtaining a non-binding delivery date for a particular
car configuration.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
These four aspects share sub-processes, but require carefully thought-out
implementation because of the physical location of the supporting IT infrastructure.
We believe that the approach we have taken allows the requested multimedia
application to be developed in such a way as to make the physical location
of the supporting IT infrastructure transparent, and will therefore fully
support all of the above aspects of the sales process.
</P>
<P>
MINT will normally start at a page giving a high-level picture of available
functions:
<UL>
<LI>
Choice of desired vehicle by family/model
</LI>
<LI>
Choice of desired vehicle(s) by price ceiling
</LI>
<LI>
Choice of desired vehicle(s) by function (sports, estate etc.)
</LI>
<LI>
Resumption of a saved sales process
</LI>
<LI>
Launch of other available ACME or dealer applications
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
MINT will not be just a menu system and an integrator of other applications;
existing applications within the dealership will be utilized fully for
the information content and functionality they may provide, but this will
be done as much as possible under the direction of MINT. As an example,
MINT will be capable of dynamically configuring a vehicle on-screen in
the right power train, colour, trim level and accessories from on-screen
pictures of the available features, but the existing configuration validation
systems will be the only source of information. The dynamic configuration
will reflect the changes in choice made by the customer and/or salesman
on the screen:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Colour and trim changes will be fully reflected on the screen through the
use of special software. The effect will be to show the car on screen in
the selected colour and to allow the customer and/or salesman to rotate
it through the use of <A HREF="4_8.html#video">surround video</A> techniques in order to simulate the
effect of walking around the car or of turning around inside the car.
</LI>
<LI>
ACME options and accessories will be shown both in graphical form for selection
and, after selection, mounted on the car if they are visible externally
or internally; for example, if a customer were to choose an optional CD
player, the in-the-car surround video picture would change the standard-mounted
radio to the selected one.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
All configuration changes will be priced and a running total of the current
price will be displayed in a frame on-screen. The total will reflect any
net pricing and/or percentage discounts that may be input by the salesman.
</P>
<P>
The surround video pictures involved in the configuration process will
contain intelligent hot spots capable of acting as functionality controls
so that they may demonstrate features of the vehicle that are either normally
not seen or rarely seen (air bags etc.).
</P>
<P>
Buttons will be located on-screen to demonstrate other features that
may be of interest to the customer, like general safety, economy and performance.
MINT can be extended to utilize some over-the-counter applications to promote
understanding in the customer of the real meaning of economy and performance:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
It is possible to simulate a journey that the customer normally performs
so that fuel consumption is associated with a real-life journey in a customer's
mind. The customer can choose a realistic start and end for a journey,
and preferential speeds. These parameters would be applied the chosen car's
fuel consumption parameters and realistic geographic information. The results
could be compared to those obtained from competitor's models.
</LI>
<LI>
It is possible to show performance on a racing circuit by using simulator
games to give the customer an better idea of acceleration road holding
possibilities.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The application will maintain a list of the page addresses (URLs) that
are accesses and the order in which they are accessed; this list will be
accumulated by MINT, and will be processed at the logical end of a transaction
so that unnecessary or repetitive data is eliminated. The processed list
will be saved against a customer's name or system-assigned key if the customer&iacute;s
name is not known. The information will be available for further analysis
by ACME or to continue a sales process that was interrupted for any reason.
