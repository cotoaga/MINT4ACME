<P>
The development process is divided into many prototypes that are delivered
and tested until the final development phase begins. This will offer enough
possibilities for fine tuning and adaptation to user needs. The prototypes
will be accessible via Internet and made available to ACME and to selected
dealers as part of the User Lab function, that is part of our offer and
available from the beginning of 1998 until the end of the project.
</P>
<A NAME="prototyping"></A>
<H3>
5.3.1. Prototyping A (GUI and multimedia objects)
</H3>
<P>
The first prototype will be a <B>pure GUI prototype</B> to give a first impression
of the look &amp; feel and the display capabilities of the application.
The processes will be hard wired and there will be no traditional application
logic to encapsulate business processes from ACME. However this prototype
will show basic processes for system configuration, common vehicle information
and vehicle configuration. It will display and interact with most of the
<A HREF="4_8.html">multimedia object</A> types of the final version. This includes pictures of
different types, sounds, (surround) videos and even 3D objects. The simulation
applications for economic, performance and financial contexts will also
be available.
</P>
<P>
This first prototype will focus on one car type and offer for this one
most of the future configuration and browsing capabilities. However, the
final design will be refined from prototype to the final development phase.
</P>
<P>
With this phase we open our <B>MINT User Lab</B>. This is the core of the open
project environment and will assure the integration of ACME, dealer systems
manufacturers, dealers and selected users over the entire project.
</P>
<H3>
5.3.2. Prototype B (<A HREF="4_3.html#applicationlayer">Application Server</A>)
</H3>
<P>
The second prototype will use the first build of the <A HREF="4_3.html#applicationlayer">Application Server</A> to encapsulate the <A HREF="2_2.html">business process</A> logic and to directly access <A HREF="4_3.html#databaselayer">DS and AS data</A>. The Application Server will largely expand the flexibility of MINT, e.g. by storing customer configurations. As for all following prototype
and development phases the client side is extended and the <A HREF="4_9.html">system is documented</A>.
</P>
<H3>
5.3.3. Prototype C (<A HREF="4_3.html#replicationlayer">Replication Server</A>)
</H3>
<P>
The third prototype will be the first version that offers <A HREF="4_4.html#laptopoffline">off-line</A> working functionality. It will use the first build of the Replication Server and
the second build of the Application Server. The Replication Server will
also embed a version of the Application Server with reduced functionality
to enable the sales consultant to go through the sales process even when
he has no access to the network. The second build of the Application Server
will offer a richer set of functions e.g. <A HREF="4_7.html">data tracking</A> to identify frequently
used areas and authenticated user identification. As for all previous prototypes,
Prototype C is followed by an own testing and evaluation phase in the User
Lab.
</P>
<H3>
5.3.4. Final Development
</H3>
<P>
The final development phase will include the third build of the Application
Server and the second build of the Replication Server. The development
will include considerations from the test phases of the prototypes and
the suggestions from the User Lab.
</P>
<H3>
5.3.5. Approval of the core system
</H3>
<P>
The test and approval of the core system (MINT itself) will include deep thorough tests
for the consistency, the functions and the interfaces of the Application
Server, the Replication Server, the embedded ActiveX, Java or ShockWave
Applications and the HTML-documents.
</P>
<P>
Due to the previous test phases for the prototypes we are confident
to keep the efforts for this phase relatively low.
</P>
<H3>
5.3.6. Approval of the system integration
</H3>
<P>
This final test phase will assure that the MINT-System will perform the
requested functions and fits in the specified system environment. The integration
test will stress especially network interaction by TCP/IP and HTTP, direct
RDBMS access, the APIs to the <A HREF="4_3.html#databaselayer">DS and AS systems</A> and ActiveX services to validate the interoperability of the system elements. The testing of installation,
delivery and maintenance procedures are also part of this final test phase.
</P>
<P>
Due to the previous test phases for the prototypes we are confident
to keep the efforts for this phase also relatively low.
</P>
<A NAME="piloting"></A>
<H3>
5.3.7. Piloting
</H3>
<P>
We are confident that from the beginning of the pilot phase MINT could
be delivered parallel in all ACME countries. The necessary installation
files can be deployed by existing file broadcasting system and easily be
installed. Due to the extensive usability tests, the intuitive help system and the user acceptance efforts we expect very low training efforts.
