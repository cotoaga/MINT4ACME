<IMG SRC="title/2_3.jpg" ALT="2.3. Business Objects" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=444 HEIGHT=167>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
</NOSCRIPT>
<P>
Typically, at least four <B>business objects</B> must coexist in order for the
process to take place. These objects are also top level abstractions
of the relevant business objects.
</P>
<IMG SRC="objects/2_3.jpg" WIDTH=465 HEIGHT=320 BORDER=0 ALT="Business Objects">
<DL>
<DT>
<A NAME="customer"></A>
<B>Customer</B>
</DT>
<DD>
This object can evolve from a lead to a prospect and hopefully to a well-known customer with a personal profile and a long list of transactions.
A customer can also be an anonymous but unique access from the internet. It is one of the main
objectives to utilize the MINT application to get customer data to
support market research activities. The customer must be integrated as
a whole with the value chain. The chain must also be folded to an circle,
meaning that the customer is not only at the "selling end". He also influences
the "design and production start".
</DD>
<DT>
<A NAME="dealer"></A>
<B>Dealer</B>
</DT>
<DD>
This important point in the value chain helps to aggregate, focus and
execute market activities. From an abstract point of view, the dealer is just
a very big customer for ACME. However, a dealer is involved in far more complex processes then a customer and requires careful consideration for seamless integration with <A HREF="4_3.html#databaselayer">legacy systems</A>.
</DD>
<BR>
<DT>
<A NAME="vehicle"></A>
<B>Vehicle</B>
</DT>
<DD>
The Vehicle, as the main Product of ACME, contains a lot of business rules,
technical restrictions and marketing activities. A lot of the "behavior" of
this object is spread over different ACME-systems. The pricing of special
marketing offers, the calculation of individual configuration and the validation
of configurations and the next possible delivery date are all aspects of one
logical business object that is currently spread over a dozen of different systems.
MINT must reintegrate this central business object.
</DD>
<DT>
<A NAME="acme"></A>
<B>ACME</B>
</DT>
<DD>
This core object controls ACMEs global business rules. It is also the source
for financial functions like trade-in offers and financial options. The major part
of the ACME system can be reached by the <A HREF="4_3.html#databaselayer">database layer</A>.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
Each sub-process of the cited <A HREF="2_2.html">business processes</A> involves a number of different combinations of these business objects; how many objects interact,
the way in which they interact and the sequence of their interaction
uniquely describe different facets of the vehicle purchase process
that are generally dependent on the situation and the client.
</P>
<P>
This makes it very difficult to develop a classical
computer application for the process (multimedia or non-multimedia),
since such an application needs a large amount of structure in
the execution of the offered functionality (<A HREF="4_5.html#processes">technical and functional problems</A>) and in the location of the required information (<A HREF="4_5.html#layout">publishing and broadcasting problems</A>).
<P>
We believe that the best solution to this problem
would be the encapsulation of the business objects into a series
of services (many of which will be multimedia) that are accessed
at will and interact flexibly with each other.
</P>
<P>
We see MINT as a <A HREF="2_4.html#frameworkpic">framework</A> that will enable these
services to be effectively deployed to help the customer gather
information about a vehicle, configure the vehicle with a fair
degree of confidence in the way the vehicle will look in the model,
colour, options and accessories chosen, agree a delivery date
and financing plans with a ACME-Vehicles dealership, and ultimately purchase
the car.
</P>
<P>
We see this <A HREF="2_4.html">MINT-Framework</A> as capable of being performed
increasingly over time outside a ACME dealership (perhaps through
the Internet) up to and including the final transaction. We believe
that the MINT-Framework should be capable of being extended in
the future to cover the remote purchase of vehicles.
