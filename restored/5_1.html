                We will use a <a href="2_1.html">browser based approach</a> to develop the MINT-Application as
                a flexible state-of-the-art multimedia and network application based on standards.
                The Browser will wrap the <a href="2_2.html">sales process</a> visually by integrating the <a href="4_5.html#layout">display</a>
                and the <a href="4_5.html#processes">interaction</a> with <a href="2_3.html">business</a> and <a href="4_8.html">multimedia objects</a> from lower layers.
                The underlying <a href="4_3.html#replicationlayer">Replication</a> and <a href="4_3.html#applicationlayer">Application Server</a> will integrate the <a href="4_3.html#databaselayer">DS
                and AS applications</a> and offer <a href="4_4.html#laptopoffline">off-line working</a> capabilities. This will logically wrap the sales process.

                Due to the complexity of the <a href="5_2.html#technical">technical</a> and <a href="5_2.html#art">design</a> aspects of this project, the <a href="5_2.html">project
                management</a> itself must be state-of-the-art. To accomplish all mission
                objectives we propose an <span class="emphasis">open project environment</span> focusing on three critical
                success factors.

                    Three aspects must be carefully considered to achieve a high overall quality in
                    the MINT-project. Quality in terms of <a href="3_1.html">business functionality</a>; this aspect is covered by a dedicated <a href="5_2.html#functional">functional manager</a> with excellent knowledge of the automotive industry, their dealerships and business process engineering. Quality in terms of design; this aspect is covered by a dedicated <a href="5_2.html#art">art manager</a>. The third aspect is the quality of the technical solution, which is covered by a dedicated <a href="5_2.html#technical">technical manager</a>. The overall aspects of quality
                    are finally assured by the independent <a href="5_2.html#quality">quality manager</a>.

                <p>
                    This aspect is covered by the <span class="emphasis">open project environment</span> where the usability lab plays
                    an important role. ACME and their dealers will be integrated at a <a href="5_3.html#prototyping">very early point</a> in the project. This will help to raise the acceptance as well as to ensure the proper
                    functionality and usability.

                <p>
                    Due to the tremendous speed of development in the area of internet and multimedia technology
                    there must be a way to quickly adapt the application to new possibilities. The traditional change request approach is far too slow and expensive for both partners. Therefore, the MINT project will be implemented using the <span class="emphasis">Time Boxing</span> method.

                <h4>Project Management in 1997</h4>
                <p>
                    The "Time Boxing" method mentioned in this document was an early form of what would later evolve 
                    into agile methodologies. In 1997, the software development world was still largely dominated by 
                    waterfall methodologies, but more iterative approaches were beginning to gain traction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The emphasis on usability labs and early user testing was also somewhat ahead of its time, 
                    as formal user experience (UX) disciplines were still in their formative stages. 
                    The "open project environment" concept anticipated the more collaborative, cross-functional
                    team structures that would become standard in later agile methodologies.

    <strong>Digital Archaeology Note:</strong> This is a modern restoration of a 1997 web application. 
    The original used Flash animations, auto-playing WAV files, frames, and obsolete web technologies. 
    These have been replaced with HTML5 equivalents while preserving the original look and navigation structure. 
    Background images are now more visible, and redundant copyright footers have been removed.
