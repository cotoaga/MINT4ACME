                The development process is divided into many prototypes that are delivered
                and tested until the final development phase begins. This will offer enough
                possibilities for fine tuning and adaptation to user needs. The prototypes
                will be accessible via Internet and made available to ACME and to selected
                dealers as part of the User Lab function, that is part of our offer and
                available from the beginning of 1998 until the end of the project.

                <p>
                    The first prototype will be a <span class="emphasis">pure GUI prototype</span> to give a first impression
                    of the look &amp; feel and the display capabilities of the application.
                    The processes will be hard wired and there will be no traditional application
                    logic to encapsulate business processes from ACME. However this prototype
                    will show basic processes for system configuration, common vehicle information
                    and vehicle configuration. It will display and interact with most of the
                    <a href="4_8.html">multimedia object</a> types of the final version. This includes pictures of
                    different types, sounds, (surround) videos and even 3D objects. The simulation
                    applications for economic, performance and financial contexts will also
                    be available.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This first prototype will focus on one car type and offer for this one
                    most of the future configuration and browsing capabilities. However, the
                    final design will be refined from prototype to the final development phase.

                    With this phase we open our <span class="emphasis">MINT User Lab</span>. This is the core of the open
                    project environment and will assure the integration of ACME, dealer systems
                    manufacturers, dealers and selected users over the entire project.

                <p>
                    The second prototype will use the first build of the <a href="4_3.html#applicationlayer">Application Server</a> to encapsulate the <a href="2_2.html">business process</a> logic and to directly access <a href="4_3.html#databaselayer">DS and AS data</a>. The Application Server will largely expand the flexibility of MINT, e.g. by storing customer configurations. As for all following prototype
                    and development phases the client side is extended and the <a href="4_9.html">system is documented</a>.

                <p>
                    The third prototype will be the first version that offers <a href="4_4.html#laptopoffline">off-line</a> working functionality. It will use the first build of the Replication Server and
                    the second build of the Application Server. The Replication Server will
                    also embed a version of the Application Server with reduced functionality
                    to enable the sales consultant to go through the sales process even when
                    he has no access to the network. The second build of the Application Server
                    will offer a richer set of functions e.g. <a href="4_7.html">data tracking</a> to identify frequently
                    used areas and authenticated user identification. As for all previous prototypes,
                    Prototype C is followed by an own testing and evaluation phase in the User
                    Lab.

                    The final development phase will include the third build of the Application
                    Server and the second build of the Replication Server. The development
                    will include considerations from the test phases of the prototypes and

                <p>
                    The test and approval of the core system (MINT itself) will include deep thorough tests
                    for the consistency, the functions and the interfaces of the Application
                    Server, the Replication Server, the embedded ActiveX, Java or ShockWave
                    Applications and the HTML-documents.

                <p>
                    Due to the previous test phases for the prototypes we are confident
                    to keep the efforts for this phase relatively low.

                    This final test phase will assure that the MINT-System will perform the
                    requested functions and fits in the specified system environment. The integration
                    test will stress especially network interaction by TCP/IP and HTTP, direct
                    RDBMS access, the APIs to the <a href="4_3.html#databaselayer">DS and AS systems</a> and ActiveX services to validate the interoperability of the system elements. The testing of installation,
                    delivery and maintenance procedures are also part of this final test phase.

                <p>
                    We are confident that from the beginning of the pilot phase MINT could
                    be delivered parallel in all ACME countries. The necessary installation
                    files can be deployed by existing file broadcasting system and easily be
                    installed. Due to the extensive usability tests, the intuitive help system and the user acceptance efforts we expect very low training efforts.

                <h4>Development Methodology in 1997</h4>
                <p>
                    This section outlines what would now be recognized as an early iterative development 
                    approach, which was relatively progressive for 1997. The traditional waterfall model 
                    was still dominant at this time, but this proposal embraces concepts of early user 
                    testing, iterative prototyping, and continuous refinement that foreshadowed modern 
                    agile methodologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "User Lab" concept described here was ahead of its time, anticipating the 
                    user research labs and usability testing facilities that would become standard 
                    in software development over the following decade. The emphasis on early and 
                    continuous user involvement throughout the development process reflects modern 
                    user-centered design principles.
