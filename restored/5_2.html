                <h4>Project Team Structure in 1997</h4>
                <p>
                    In 1997, the concept of dividing project leadership between technical, functional, and design 
                    roles was somewhat innovative. Traditional software development at the time often used 
                    a more rigid hierarchy with a single project manager and technical leads, without explicitly 
                    positioning design leadership at the same level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reference to ISO9001 reflects the increasing importance of formal quality management 
                    systems in software development in the late 1990s. The prominence given to the Art Director 
                    role highlights the recognition that web applications required both technical engineering 
                    and creative design leadership—a concept that would eventually evolve into today's UX/UI 
                    leadership positions.
