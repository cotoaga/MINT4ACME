                direction from ACME to the dealer (or public kiosk). ACME can provide creative
                material and multimedia objects manufactured by advertising agencies. The
                objects are distributed by triggering the replication server to fetch new
                objects. All the types of MMOs that follow can be supported. However, it
                is expected that there will be a focus on some types because the underlying

                    Java Applets can be implemented as simulators to explain difficult or abstract

                    used even for big applications.

                    <h4>Flash/ShockWave in 1997</h4>
                    <p>
                        In 1997, Macromedia Flash (later acquired by Adobe) was emerging as a powerful tool for 
                        creating interactive animations and experiences. Flash and ShockWave were considered cutting-edge 
                        technologies that enabled rich multimedia experiences in web browsers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Flash was widely used for automotive sites in the late 1990s and 2000s, providing immersive 
                        vehicle configurators, animations, and interactive demonstrations that weren't possible with 
                        HTML alone. Flash support was discontinued in all modern browsers by January 2021.

                <p>
                    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/activex" target="_blank">ActiveX</a> controls are essential for some sophisticated display and interaction functions but can be also used as an alternative to Java or ShockWave.
                    From a technical point of view ActiveX controls are distributed OLE controls
                    and can be executed as fast as normal applications. However, the development
                    efforts are also higher than those for Java or ShockWave. ActiveX can be
                    distributed over TCP/IP networks but are restricted to Intel platforms.
                    Another main disadvantage of ActiveX solutions are the system intrinsic
                    security risks. Visit the <a href="http://carpoint.msn.com/Gallery" target="_blank">CarPoint</a> Web-Site from Microsoft for surround video examples using ActiveX technology.

                    <p>
                        ActiveX was Microsoft's response to Java and browser plugins, allowing Windows software 
                        components to be embedded in web pages. While powerful, ActiveX controls were limited to 
                        Internet Explorer on Windows platforms, and posed significant security concerns because 
                        they had deep access to the operating system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Microsoft CarPoint (mentioned in the original document) was one of the first automotive 
                        websites to use ActiveX for advanced vehicle visualization features. ActiveX has since 
                        been deprecated due to security concerns and the move toward cross-platform web standards.

                        In 1997, video on the web was still in its early stages. QuickTime VR was a groundbreaking

                        and MIDI files (for music). MIDI files were particularly popular because of their small file 
                        size—critical in the era of dial-up connections.

                        The reference to "wavetable soundcards" reflects the hardware limitations of the time. Without 
                        specialized sound hardware, MIDI playback would use basic FM synthesis, resulting in lower quality audio.

                    Today, audio on the web primarily uses MP3, AAC, or OGG formats with the HTML5 audio element, 
                    which offers better quality and broader compatibility.

    <strong>Digital Archaeology Note:</strong> This is a modern restoration of a 1997 web application. 
    The original used Flash animations, auto-playing WAV files, frames, and obsolete web technologies. 
    These have been replaced with HTML5 equivalents while preserving the original look and navigation structure. 
    Background images are now more visible, and redundant copyright footers have been removed.
