                    The statistical information obtained by MINT is related to a complex hypermedia
                    document. It is essential to offer a way to understanding this graph for
                    optimization and analysis purpose. The proposal contains a graph-based
                    visualization tool that shows frequently used areas (pages) and the path
                    through the system.

                <h4>Historical Context: Web Analytics in 1997</h4>
                <p>
                    In 1997, web analytics was a nascent field. The tools commonly available at the time were
                    basic server log analyzers like Analog, WebTrends, and AWStats that tracked simple metrics
                    such as page views, referrers, and browser types.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "graph-based visualization" mentioned was an advanced concept for its time. What MINT
                    proposed—tracking user paths through a complex hypermedia system—presaged modern heat mapping,
                    user journey analysis, and behavior flow visualization that wouldn't become mainstream for
                    another decade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original page contained a link to a VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) 3D visualization
                    that would have shown interactive navigation paths through the system. This was cutting-edge
                    technology for visualizing complex data in 1997.

    <strong>Digital Archaeology Note:</strong> This is a modern restoration of a 1997 web application. 
    The original used Flash animations, auto-playing WAV files, frames, and obsolete web technologies. 
    These have been replaced with HTML5 equivalents while preserving the original look and navigation structure. 
    Background images are now more visible, and redundant copyright footers have been removed.
