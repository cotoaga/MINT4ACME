                ACME-Vehicles wants to protect and extend their market share in Europe
                against local and international <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970101000000*/netscape.yahoo.com/guide/shopping/autos.html" target="_blank">competitors</a>. Although ACME has a good market
                position it is clear that they cannot rest on their laurels if they want
                to continue enjoying their current success in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970101000000*/www.europa.eu.int/pol/singl/en/singl.htm" target="_blank">European market</a> is highly differentiated due to the many countries
                and to the cultural differences and preferences of their inhabitants. The
                high speed of technical and social development (eg. EU interation, upcoming
                environmental standards, etc.) makes this important market with high spending
                power hard to deal with. The successful business performance of ACME depends
                on streamlined business and information processes that integrate the value
                chains of producer, dealers and customers. This enables ACME to react more
                quickly to customer needs and to anticipate future trends.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most critical participants in the vehicle selling process
                is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970101000000*/www.autobyinternet.com/" target="_blank">dealership</a>, where ACME and dealer information systems meet each other. The solution should help both ACME an their dealers to bind customers
                by a short time to market for perfect customized products utilizing new
                media and technology. The special problem for a truly integrated sales
                process arises from fragmented legacy systems developed by various companies
                at the dealer site. The common problem is to break the physical boundaries
                of the dealer showrooms and to bring this showrooms everywhere by utilizing
                <a href="4_1.html">internet and multimedia technology</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The task of a cutting edge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970101000000*/www.yahoo.com/Computers/" target="_blank">information and communication technology</a>
                provider is to help ACME to overcome this problems. As a consequence, ACME
                has invited to tender for the MINT-Application.
