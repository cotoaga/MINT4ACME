                The automotive sales process faces several critical challenges that MINT aims to address. 
                These challenges span technology, business processes, and customer expectations.
            </p>
            
            <div class="problem-section">
                <h3>System Integration Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    Dealerships typically operate a heterogeneous mix of legacy systems, developed over many years
                    by different vendors. These systems are often poorly integrated, resulting in data
                    inconsistencies, duplicate data entry, and inefficient workflows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ACME's manufacturing systems produce valuable product data and media assets, but
                    these are difficult to distribute and maintain across the dealer network. The current
                    process for updating product information at dealerships is manual, slow, and error-prone.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="problem-section">
                <h3>Customer Experience Limitations</h3>
                <p>
                    Today's customers expect rich, interactive experiences when shopping for vehicles.
                    Traditional brochures and static displays cannot adequately convey the full range
                    of features, options, and customizations available for modern vehicles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Customers want to visualize vehicles with their chosen options and configurations,
                    but physical showrooms can only display a limited number of actual vehicles.
                    This limitation forces customers to imagine combinations rather than seeing them directly.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="problem-section">
                <h3>Sales Process Inefficiencies</h3>
                <p>
                    Sales staff must currently reference multiple information sources during the sales process:
                    printed catalogs, price lists, technical specifications, and financing information.
                    This fragmented approach leads to longer sales cycles and potential information gaps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When customers request custom configurations, sales staff often cannot provide immediate
                    feedback on availability, pricing, or delivery timelines. This uncertainty can lead
                    to lost sales opportunities or customer dissatisfaction.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                The MINT framework provides a <a href="2_1.html">comprehensive solution</a> to these challenges by creating
                an integrated, multimedia-rich platform for vehicle sales and configuration. By bringing
                together product information, visualization tools, and ordering systems, MINT transforms
                the automotive sales process for both dealers and customers.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A key innovation of MINT is its ability to function effectively both online and <a href="4_4.html">offline</a>,
                ensuring consistent performance regardless of network connectivity. This capability is
                particularly important for dealerships in locations with unreliable internet access or
                during off-site sales events.

    <strong>Digital Archaeology Note:</strong> This is a modern restoration of a 1997 web application. 
    The original used Flash animations, auto-playing WAV files, frames, and obsolete web technologies. 
    These have been replaced with HTML5 equivalents while preserving the original look and navigation structure. 
    Background images are now more visible, and redundant copyright footers have been removed.
