                The MINT framework is structured around key business processes in the automotive sales lifecycle.
                By focusing on these processes rather than on technical capabilities, MINT ensures that technology
                serves the business needs of ACME and its dealer network.

                The <a href="2_4.html">framework structure</a> provides the technical foundation for these processes,
