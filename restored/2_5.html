                    <p>
                        MINT bridges the gap between manufacturer and dealer systems, creating a seamless sales 
                        process from initial customer interest through vehicle delivery and after-sales support.

                    <p>
                        The rich multimedia presentation capabilities provide customers with a more engaging and 
                        informative shopping experience, whether in the dealership or remotely.

                        MINT's ability to function without continuous network connectivity enables sales staff to 
                        use the application in various environments, from showrooms to trade shows to customer locations.

    <strong>Digital Archaeology Note:</strong> This is a modern restoration of a 1997 web application. 
    The original used Flash animations, auto-playing WAV files, frames, and obsolete web technologies. 
    These have been replaced with HTML5 equivalents while preserving the original look and navigation structure. 
    Background images are now more visible, and redundant copyright footers have been removed.
