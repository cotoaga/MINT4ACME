                The previous two sections <a href="4_3.html">"Layers"</a> and <a href="4_4.html">"Versions"</a> 
                have described the system elements of the proposed MINT solution and their interaction. However,
                there are some aspects that are not specific for one layer or one version.
                One of the most important aspects of the MINT system is the <span class="emphasis">separation
                between the information technology</span> including the distribution of the application
                and the process logic defined by ACME business rules <span class="emphasis">and the creative layout,
                design and branding of the displayed objects</span>.
            </p>
            
            <div id="layout" class="section">
                <div class="section-badge">UI Design</div>
                <h3>4.5.1. Layout configuration</h3>
                
                <p>
                    This layout section outlines the possibilities and limits of the display
                    capabilities of the system. The display area of the browser is controlled
                    by HTML. HTML defines the structural layout of the content that should
                    be displayed within the display area. It can embed <a href="4_8.html">multimedia objects</a> of
                    very different types and even some <a href="#processes">application logic</a>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    HTML is the <a href="http://www.w3c.org" target="_blank">World-Wide Web</a> standard for documents 
                    and assures world-wide acceptance and continual development and enhancement. The usage of HTML
                    as a basic description language for the layout and design guarantees a
                    permanent state-of-the-art MINT that can use new web-features as they become
                    available. Another important advantage is the easy reusability of web-design
                    already done by creative advertising agencies for ACME. HTML offers the
                    possibility to divide creative design and application logic.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Each HTML page should represent an indivisible decision stage in the
                    configuration and order process. Examples are:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Customer identification page</li>
                    <li>Model introduction pages and areas</li>
                    <li>Model selection page</li>
                    <li>Motor selection page</li>
                    <li>Colour selection page etc.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    HTML offers a large set of features to control the display of the content.
                    Some examples are:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Structural text layout</li>
                    <li>Different fonts and colors</li>
                    <li>Relative placement, which solves the problem of different display resolutions
                        available for laptops and client computers</li>
                    <li>Tables</li>
                    <li><a href="4_8.html#pictures">Pictures</a>, <a href="4_8.html#sound">Sound</a> and <a href="4_8.html#video">Videos</a></li>
                    <li><a href="4_8.html#activex">ActiveX</a>, <a href="4_8.html#java">Java</a> or <a href="4_8.html#shockwave">ShockWave</a> objects (small multimedia applications, that
                        are distributed over the network with different technologies)</li>
                    <li>Forms, to enter data and forward the data to a server for further processing.
                        Forms can be composed out of the usual GUI input controls like text fields,
                        drop down list boxes or radio buttons.</li>
                    <li><a href="help.html#addons">Java-Script</a> (adds simple application logic)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div id="processes" class="section">
                <div class="section-badge">Flow Control</div>
                <h3>4.5.2. Process configuration</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The content that is displayed in the display area is assembled by the <a href="4_3.html#applicationlayer">application
                    server</a> from template pages, input fields and <a href="4_8.html">multimedia objects</a>. These pages
                    can be viewed as decision stages in the <a href="2_2.html#infophase">information retrieving</a>, 
                    <a href="2_2.html#negotiationphase">negotiation and configuration</a> or ordering process. The 
                    <a href="2_3.html#customer">customer</a> or the <a href="2_3.html#dealer">sales consultant</a> are selecting features, 
                    accessing hot-spots on pictures for further details, using small simulation applications to explain 
                    difficult technical context and adding more and more data. Whenever there are no further question in
                    a decision stage, e.g. the right power train is chosen after comparing
                    different alternatives, this data is passed to the <a href="4_3.html#applicationlayer">Application Server</a>. 
                    The settings determined during each decision stage are added to the configuration
                    and the next step begins by passing the added values and selections to
                    the application server. The application server reacts by answering with
                    the next page suited to refine the configuration.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If interactive actions are required at any decision stage, like price
                    updating, this is solved by embedded Java-Script that is executed as part
                    of the document.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The <span class="emphasis">process logic</span> (the order in which data is passed from one application
                    to the next) is embedded in the <a href="4_3.html#applicationlayer">Application Server</a>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Since the order of execution of the process logic is subject to human
                    vagaries (a customer might want to know the trade-in value of his car at
                    the beginning, in the middle or at the end of a sales process etc.) the
                    <a href="4_3.html#applicationlayer">Application Server</a> needs to be able to operate with non-complete sets of information; 
                    this will be done by default assumptions where possible, and
                    by requesting specific information where needed.
