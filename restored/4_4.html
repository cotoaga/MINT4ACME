                The MINT application comes in several versions tailored to different use cases and 
                deployment scenarios. Each version leverages the same core architecture but is optimized 
                for specific operational contexts and user roles.

                <p>
                    This is the full-featured version of the MINT-Application that can be used
                    to access and configure the system.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    To use all possibilities, the sales consultant has to log-on and
                    identify himself. This version uses all <a href="4_3.html">layers</a>.
                </p>
                
                <p>Some of the available functions are:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>System configuration</li>
                    <li>User administration</li>
                    <li>Authenticated identification (password log-on)</li>
                    <li>Pre-configuration of vehicles</li>
                    <li>Edit the dealer corporate identity</li>
                    <li>Edit dealer specific accessories</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    The following sales process (<a href="2_2.html#negotiationphase">negotiation phase</a>) 
                    describes a typical pre-sales operation: After the <a href="2_3.html#dealer">sales consultant</a> 
                    has logged onto the system, a well-known <a href="2_3.html#customer">customer</a> asks for some information.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The sales consultant enters the name of the customer and reloads the
                    last configuration, e.g. stored by the customer himself, using the showroom
                    or <a href="#publickiosk">public kiosk version</a>. After that, the sales consultant and customer
                    discuss and check additional accessories and features supported by the
                    available multimedia material. The new vehicle configuration data is entered
                    and validated by accessing the ACME system through the <a href="4_3.html#applicationlayer">Application Server</a>. 
                    The vehicle locator reveals that the vehicle (or a similar one) is neither
                    in stock nor on the production list in the near future, but the system
                    has stored this request and will alert the sales consultant when this changes,
                    so he can contact his prospect.

                <p>
                    This version is mostly for the <a href="2_2.html#closurephase">closure phase</a> of the sales process 
                    and has special features to access pre-defined general or personal configurations.
                    It offers most of the <a href="#dealermint">Dealer-MINT</a> functions and is optimized to work even
                    with slow modem network connection. To reduce network traffic the MMOs
                    will be accessed directly on the laptop by using the <a href="4_3.html#replicationlayer">Replication Server</a>. 
                    The updating process of huge files can be suppressed, to speed up the sales
                    process. When the network is available, the online laptop MINT can be used
                    just as any other client computer at the dealer site. To connect to the
                    dealer systems it uses SLIP or PPP capabilities of the operation system.

                    This version is also for the <a href="2_2.html#closurephase">closure phase</a> of the sales process. 
                    When the <a href="4_3.html#replicationlayer">Replication Server</a> cannot establish a permanent 
                    network connection it automatically switches to off-line mode. In this mode access statistics,
                    configurations and orders are cached within the replication server until
                    the network is available. The process logic is controlled by
                    a reduced <a href="4_3.html#applicationlayer">Application Server</a>, that is embedded within the 
                    Replication Server. Orders placed in this mode are not confirmed until there is a connection
                    to the dealer or ACME systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the Replication Server can reestablish a permanent network connection it flushes
                    all data stored in off-line mode. Orders are checked and validated. Statistical
                    information is forwarded and problems resulting from unresolvable order constraints
                    are signaled to the dealer and ACME systems and if possible also to the customer.

                <h3>4.4.4. Public Kiosk-MINT</h3>
                
                <div class="version-image">

                <p>
                    The public kiosk version supports the <a href="2_2.html#infophase">information phase</a> of the sales process. 
                    It offers the same functions as the <a href="#dealermint">Dealer-MINT versions</a>, but without sophisticated 
                    editing and negotiation features. The customer can identify himself, if
                    he is willing to, and browse around. In case of an anonymous access, <a href="4_7.html">statistic
                    information</a> and configurations are stored but cannot be accessed by the
                    customer later on. The customer can get a standard non-negotiated quotation
                    for his part-exchange vehicle. Even when the customer refuses to identify
                    himself, the system can gather data and assign this to an anonymous default
                    customer. This version can be used both for the dealer showroom, as for
                    public areas or the internet.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    For the requested public kiosk version there are two possible access
                    ways depending on a central or distributed approach. The central approach
                    would require an application server with reduced functionality, which makes
                    no use of dealer data. It would be maintained centrally by ACME and would
                    offer only the required configuration possibilities. The configuration
                    could also be passed to a dealer for further handling of the potential
                    customer. Another possibility would be to allow direct access from the
                    Internet to the dealer system.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    As, for all other versions, data is forwarded to the <a href="4_3.html#applicationlayer">Application Server</a> 
                    as soon as possible. This assures, that the sales consultant and ACME can
                    use the statistical information and customer data to sell more vehicles.
