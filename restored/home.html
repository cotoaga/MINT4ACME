        <div class="intro">
            <p>This presentation describes our vision and concept for an integrated internet based multimedia solution for the automotive industry.</p>
            <p>We will describe the actual situation and expected tendencies for the near future from the viewpoint of a big European vehicle manufacturer. We have chosen the name <strong><em>A</em>-<em>C</em>ar <em>M</em>anufacturer in <em>E</em>urope</strong> (<strong>ACME</strong>) for this company.</p>
            <p>ACME-Vehicles, as an innovative company, has already realized the need for such an application. ACME has invited to tender for the development of a <strong><em>M</em>ultimedia <em>I</em>nformation, <em>N</em>egotiation and <em>T</em>ransaction</strong> application (<strong>MINT</strong>-Application). MINT should integrate existing dealer and ACME systems under a state-of-the-art user interface.</p>

    <strong>Digital Archaeology Note:</strong> This is a modern restoration of a 1997 web application. 
    The original used Flash animations, auto-playing WAV files, frames, and obsolete web technologies. 
    These have been replaced with HTML5 equivalents while preserving the original look and navigation structure. 
    Background images are now more visible, and redundant copyright footers have been removed.
