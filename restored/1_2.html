                The primary goal of MINT is to provide a flexible application
                framework for the sales staff of <a href="../original/objects/mbenz_final.gif" target="_blank">ACME-Vehicles</a>.
                This framework must fulfill several key requirements:
            </p>
            
            <ul class="objectives">
                <li>
                    <strong>Vehicle Presentation:</strong> Support multimedia presentation of vehicles 
                    across different contexts, from dealership showrooms to trade shows.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sales Support:</strong> Assist sales staff with guided selling, demonstrating 
                    vehicle features and benefits in an interactive manner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Configuration:</strong> Allow customers to customize vehicles with various 
                    options and see the results in real-time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Information Access:</strong> Provide on-demand access to detailed product 
                    information, technical specifications, and pricing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Offline Operation:</strong> Function effectively in environments without 
                    continuous network connectivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Integration:</strong> Seamlessly integrate with existing dealer management 
                    systems and manufacturer databases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Operate across multiple hardware platforms 
                    and operating systems to accommodate diverse dealer environments.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                A critical secondary goal is the provision of a flexible framework
                that can be easily adapted to meet changing market requirements
                and evolving multimedia technology. The solution must support
                advanced visualization techniques while remaining accessible to
                users with standard browser configurations.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All the multimedia components (images, animations, text) will be stored
                in a <a href="4_3.html">multimedia database</a>. This database will be replicated to
                all offline installations. A sophisticated update management ensures
                that all installations have the latest content.

    <strong>Digital Archaeology Note:</strong> This is a modern restoration of a 1997 web application. 
    The original used Flash animations, auto-playing WAV files, frames, and obsolete web technologies. 
    These have been replaced with HTML5 equivalents while preserving the original look and navigation structure. 
    Background images are now more visible, and redundant copyright footers have been removed.
