                <p>
                    The system documentation itself is a HTML hypermedia document. It can reside
                    (full version) on a central ACME site, or partly on the dealer system.
                    The goal is to reduce adaptation and maintenance effort by allowing fast
                    access to the relevant data. This is even more important if the creative
                    appearance of the system is maintained by a third party in the future.

                    The MINT-Application will inherently be usable in a very intuitive way as this document itself.
                    However, MINT will also have an integrated help system to guide customers
                    or sales consultants through the system. The help system is interactive
                    and can be accessed from every area. The goal is to reduce the <a href="5_3.html#piloting">training
                    efforts</a> and to increase acceptance of the system.

                <h4>Online Help Systems in 1997</h4>
                <p>
                    In 1997, online help systems were in transition from traditional Windows Help files (.HLP) 
                    to HTML-based documentation. Using HTML for both the application and its documentation was 
                    a forward-thinking approach that aligned with emerging web standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept of "hypermedia documentation" mentioned in this section represented a shift 
                    toward more interactive and interconnected help systems, rather than linear manuals. This 
                    approach is now standard in modern applications, but was relatively innovative at the time.

    <strong>Digital Archaeology Note:</strong> This is a modern restoration of a 1997 web application. 
    The original used Flash animations, auto-playing WAV files, frames, and obsolete web technologies. 
    These have been replaced with HTML5 equivalents while preserving the original look and navigation structure. 
    Background images are now more visible, and redundant copyright footers have been removed.
