                    All layers will provide the traditional Unix security. By using secure
                    HTTP (HTTPS) the security level can be greatly enhanced. This public key
                    cryptographic method allows the encryption of the data passed over public
                    channels.

                <h4>Historical Context: Security in 1997</h4>
                <p>
                    When this document was created in 1997, web security was still in its early stages. 
                    SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) version 2.0 had been released in 1995, and SSL 3.0 was released 
                    in 1996. HTTPS was relatively new, and many websites still operated entirely over unsecured HTTP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reference to "traditional Unix security" likely refers to permission-based file systems, 
                    user authentication, and access control lists that were standard in Unix environments at the time.
                    Public key cryptography was still considered advanced technology for most commercial applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section is notably brief compared to how security would be treated in a modern application
                    proposal, reflecting the less complex threat landscape of the time and the nascent state of
                    web application security standards.

    <strong>Digital Archaeology Note:</strong> This is a modern restoration of a 1997 web application. 
    The original used Flash animations, auto-playing WAV files, frames, and obsolete web technologies. 
    These have been replaced with HTML5 equivalents while preserving the original look and navigation structure. 
    Background images are now more visible, and redundant copyright footers have been removed.
