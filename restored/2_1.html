                The MINT framework represents a significant paradigm shift in automotive sales applications. 
                Rather than creating an isolated sales tool, MINT establishes a comprehensive ecosystem that 
                integrates across the entire vehicle sales lifecycle.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Our approach is rooted in four fundamental principles that guide the design and implementation 
                of the MINT framework:
            </p>
            
            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>MINT Framework Principles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Integration-First Design:</strong> MINT is built to integrate seamlessly with existing 
                    dealer management systems and manufacturer databases, rather than replacing them.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Business Process Orientation:</strong> The framework is structured around key business 
                    processes in the automotive sales lifecycle, ensuring that technology serves business needs.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Layered Architecture:</strong> A four-layer architecture separates presentation, business 
                    logic, data access, and infrastructure concerns, creating maximum flexibility.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Media-Rich Experience:</strong> Multimedia assets are treated as first-class citizens within 
                    the framework, with sophisticated management and presentation capabilities.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                The MINT framework is implemented as a <a href="4_3.html">four-layer architecture</a>, with each layer responsible 
                for specific aspects of the application. This separation of concerns allows for maximum flexibility 
                in deployment and customization:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Presentation Layer:</strong> Handles user interface, multimedia presentation, and interactive 
                elements using web technologies and multimedia plugins.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Business Logic Layer:</strong> Implements core functionality, business rules, and process 
                workflows that drive the application.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Data Access Layer:</strong> Manages data retrieval, storage, and synchronization between 
                local and remote systems.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Layer:</strong> Provides foundational services like networking, security, 
                and system integration capabilities.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                This layered approach enables MINT to operate effectively in both <a href="4_4.html">online and offline modes</a>, 
                with sophisticated synchronization mechanisms ensuring data consistency across all installations.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The resulting framework provides ACME and its dealers with a powerful platform for vehicle sales 
                that can adapt to changing business requirements and technological capabilities. The next sections 
                will explore the <a href="2_2.html">business processes</a>, <a href="2_3.html">business objects</a>, and

    <strong>Digital Archaeology Note:</strong> This is a modern restoration of a 1997 web application. 
    The original used Flash animations, auto-playing WAV files, frames, and obsolete web technologies. 
    These have been replaced with HTML5 equivalents while preserving the original look and navigation structure. 
    Background images are now more visible, and redundant copyright footers have been removed.
